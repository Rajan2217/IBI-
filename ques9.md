The code below will output the following to the console:

array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

Let's go step-by-step through the code to understand why this is the output:

var arr1 = "john".split('');: The split() method is used to convert the string "john" into an array ['j', 'o', 'h', 'n']. So, arr1 becomes ['j', 'o', 'h', 'n'].

var arr2 = arr1.reverse();: The reverse() method is called on arr1, which reverses the array in place. Now, arr1 and arr2 both point to the same reversed array ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j']. The reverse operation modifies the original array and also returns a reference to the same array.

var arr3 = "jones".split('');: The split() method is used to convert the string "jones" into an array ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']. So, arr3 becomes ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's'].

arr2.push(arr3);: The push() method is used to add the array arr3 as a single element to the end of arr2. Since arr2 and arr1 are referencing the same array (due to the previous arr1.reverse() operation), both arr1 and arr2 are affected by this push() operation.

Now, let's look at the console.log statements:

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));: The length of the array arr1 is 5, and arr1.slice(-1) gives the last element of the array, which is 's'. So, the first console.log statement prints: array 1: length=5 last=s.

console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));: The length of the array arr2 is also 5 (since arr1 and arr2 point to the same array). The arr2.slice(-1) gives the last element of the array, which is also 's'. So, the second console.log statement prints: array 2: length=5 last=s.

In conclusion, both arr1 and arr2 point to the same reversed array, and the push() operation affects both arrays. Hence, the output shows that both arrays have a length of 5 and the last element is 's'.
