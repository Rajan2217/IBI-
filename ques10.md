Here's the explanation of the sequence:

console.log(1);: The number 1 is logged to the console first. This is a synchronous operation and executes immediately when encountered in the code.

setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);: A setTimeout function is used to schedule the execution of printNumber with num equal to 2 after a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is 0, it is still an asynchronous operation, and the callback function (printNumber) is added to the event queue.

setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);: Another setTimeout function is used to schedule the execution of printNumber with num equal to 3 after a delay of 100 milliseconds. This is also an asynchronous operation, and the callback is added to the event queue after 100 milliseconds.

console.log(4);: The number 4 is logged to the console. This is another synchronous operation and executes immediately after the previous statement.

Now, let's look at the event queue and the order of execution:

At time 0 milliseconds: The first setTimeout with num 2 is added to the event queue. (Note: The delay of 0 milliseconds doesn't mean it will be executed immediately; it will be added to the event queue after other synchronous tasks are completed.)

At time 0 milliseconds: The second setTimeout with num 3 is also added to the event queue. It is added after the first one because it has a delay of 100 milliseconds.

At this point, the event queue looks like: [setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2), setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3)]

After all synchronous tasks are completed (console.log statements), the event loop starts processing the tasks in the event queue.

The first task in the event queue is setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2). The callback printNumber(2) is executed, and the number 2 is logged to the console.

The second task in the event queue is setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3). The callback printNumber(3) is executed, and the number 3 is logged to the console.

So, the final output sequence is: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
