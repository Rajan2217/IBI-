The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console in that order when the code is executed.

Here's the breakdown of the order and the reasons why:

console.log(1);: The number 1 is logged to the console first. This is a synchronous operation, and it executes
immediately when the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is invoked.

setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);: The number 2 is logged to the console after a delay of 1000
milliseconds (1 second). Even though it has a delay, this is an asynchronous operation, so it doesn't block the
execution of the rest of the code. Instead, it schedules the callback function to be executed after the specified
delay.

setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);: The number 3 is logged to the console after a delay of 0 milliseconds.
This may seem counterintuitive, but it's important to understand that the delay specified in setTimeout represents
the minimum delay, not the exact delay. So, even though it's set to 0, it's still an asynchronous operation, and the
callback function is scheduled to run as soon as possible, but after the synchronous code finishes executing.

console.log(4);: The number 4 is logged to the console last. This is a synchronous operation that executes
immediately after the previous statement.

So, the order of logs will be: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2

To summarize, even though setTimeout is used to schedule asynchronous callbacks, the order in which they execute
depends on the event loop and the execution context, not the specified delay. The synchronous code executes first,
and then the asynchronous callbacks are executed in the order they were scheduled.
